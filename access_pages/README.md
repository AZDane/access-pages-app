# Access Pages for Home Assistant

Access Pages gives temporary guests access to a small, explicitly
approved part of Home Assistant without making Home Assistant or the
home network publicly reachable.

A guest can be given a purpose-built page containing only the devices,
information, and controls they need. They do not need a Home Assistant
account, password, or VPN access, and no inbound router port needs to be
opened.

## The challenge

Giving temporary guests access to Home Assistant creates a difficult set
of requirements:

-   Home Assistant and the home network should not become publicly
    reachable.
-   No inbound router ports should need to be opened.
-   Temporary visitors should not require Home Assistant accounts,
    passwords, or VPN access.
-   Guests should see only the devices and controls they need.
-   Access should expire automatically and remain revocable at any time.
-   Revoking one guest should not interrupt anyone else.

AI-assisted reconnaissance and exploitation are rapidly shrinking the
time between the discovery of a vulnerability and active attacks against
it. As attacks move toward machine speed, protecting a publicly
discoverable service becomes an increasingly difficult race.

**The safest endpoint is one an unauthorized attacker cannot discover or
reach. You cannot attack what you cannot see.**

## Local by design

This approach aligns with Home Assistant's vision of the Open Home,
which places privacy, choice, and sustainability at the heart of the
smart home.

Home Assistant states that devices should work locally and that cloud
connections should be additional and opt-in. Access Pages preserves that
local-first model: Home Assistant, its devices, and its administrative
interface remain inside the home.

The goal is not to move Home Assistant into the cloud. It is to let an
authorized guest reach a small, explicitly approved part of it without
exposing Home Assistant or the home network to the public internet.

## An invisible path to the home

Access Pages uses the **Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP)**,
a cryptography-powered Zero Trust protocol based on an
**authenticate-before-connect** model.

Traditional remote-access services expose an endpoint first and
authenticate the visitor after a connection has been made. NHP reverses
that order. The protected endpoint remains invisible and unreachable
until access has been cryptographically verified.

NHP is the open-source network-hiding technology developed by OpenNHP.
The LayerV team are core builders of OpenNHP, and LayerV's founding team
co-authored the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) NHP specification. LayerV
is the enterprise implementation of that foundation, providing the
managed access service and developer tools used by Access Pages. The
protocol is also documented in an IETF Internet-Draft.

For more about the relationship between LayerV, OpenNHP, the CSA
specification, and the IETF work, see
[LayerV's OpenNHP standards page](https://layerv.ai/standards/).

The Access Pages App establishes the protected NHP/FRP path. A guest
reaches that path through a valid LayerV qURL rather than through a
public Home Assistant or Gateway endpoint.

## Purpose-limited guest access

After the protected path is available, the Access Pages Gateway limits
what the guest can actually use.

Each guest receives an independent access grant. The grant determines
how long access lasts and whether the invitation is renewable or
single-use where supported.

The guest-facing page is narrowly limited to the capabilities selected
by the Home Assistant administrator.

For example, a **Cat Sitter** page might allow someone to:

-   unlock a selected door;
-   turn selected lights on or off;
-   check the temperature in a room; and
-   view periodic still images from a selected camera.

It does not expose the regular Home Assistant dashboard, configuration,
history, or unrelated entities.

The Gateway enforces the approved capabilities on the server. The
browser cannot gain additional Home Assistant capabilities simply by
changing what it submits.

## More than a hidden URL

Access Pages does not rely on the secrecy of a public web address.

The NHP-controlled access path is kept out of reach until admission
succeeds, while the Gateway independently limits the capabilities
available after admission.

The guest-facing runtime is also isolated from privileged Gateway
functions. It is not given general Home Assistant administrative
authority or the credentials used to manage LayerV access.

Additional controls include expiration, individual revocation, optional
email-code verification, optional proximity requirements for actions,
guest activity records, security events, administrator alerts, and
read-only camera stills.

## Getting started

Access Pages runs as a Home Assistant App. Remote guest access is
provided through LayerV.

1.  Install **Access Pages**.
2.  Create or sign in to a LayerV account.
3.  Create a dedicated LayerV API key for this installation.
4.  Connect Access Pages to LayerV.
5.  Create an Access Page and choose its Home Assistant entities and
    permitted actions.
6.  Create a guest, choose the access lifetime and optional protections,
    and share the generated qURL.

See [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) for complete setup and operating instructions.
